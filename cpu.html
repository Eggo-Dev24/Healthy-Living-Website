                <p>Sleeping Habits</p>
                <p>Sleep is a major part of every animal, where we get tired and must sleep to recharge ourselves to be stable enough to go through what the world has for us.</p>
                <p>What is a Sleep Schedule?</p>
                <p>A sleep schedule is a schedule set for when you should go to sleep, and how long you should sleep for.</p>
                <p>Sleeping habits are important due to how not getting enough sleep may lead to things like your emotional state and attention span being worsened for that day, as well as long term issues like increased chances of gaining memory problems.​</p>
                <p>The number of hours of sleep needed depends on a person's age. The children 10 hours is needed, for teens it's 9 hours, and adults need 8 hours of sleep.​</p>
                <p>The aspects of a healthy sleep schedule would be to go to sleep at the same time each day if possible, as well as giving yourself 30 minutes away from things like phone screens and monitors before going to sleep, as exposure to screens may trick your body into staying awake as it may believe it is morning.</p>
